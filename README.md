# Job interview assignment

We kindly ask you to solve the task below. By solving and submitting this assignment you provide us with insights in how you solve real-world problems. What we will be looking at are topics such as: choice of technology, structuring of code, use of VCS, selection of 3rd party libraries, documentation etc.

## The task

Develop a solution that, given a select query, can read data from a database, write it to a local file and then delete the data from the database. The solution should verify that data is written to the file, and that data integrity is maintained, before deleting it from the database.

- Use Bash, PHP, JavaScript or Go as the language
- Use MySQL, MariaDB, CockroachDB or SQLite as the database

Please use the data set provided in the SQL dump in this repo. Please also consider that your solution should be able to handle much larger data sets.

## Expectations

Make a copy of this repo. Solve the task below. Push your code to a public repo, and send us the link as a reply to our email.

Your solution should include a short readme describing your solution, how to use/test it and any final considerations such as known errors, next steps, security concerns etc. Donâ€™t worry we are not expecting this thing to be perfect.

## Solution

I have chosen mysql as database and Nodejs as runtime using Javascript as programming language.

The solution that I have written is a graphql server with following two endpoints:

```gaphql
users: [User]
```

and

```graphql
writeAndDeleteUser(
id: ID!
): Status!
```

The `users` endpoint will list all of the users available in your database.

The `writeAndDeleteUser` endpoint will query for a certain user based on the id provided, then it write the user in a file and deletes the row. It will return a Status object with message and a status code.

### Get started locally

In order to start the server locally need you have `nodejs` and `mysql` installed on your machine.

Then you will need to run `npm install` to install of the dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

### Get started Using Docker

You will need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in order to get started with docker.

#### Download image from repo

The docker-compose file has a link to the pre-built image for the application that you can download.
However you need login with docker in order to be able to pull the image.
Here is a quick how to do a docker login.

1. Create a new Personal access token on [Github](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Make sure you have read/write rights for packages
1. Copy your personal access token to your clipboard
1. run following command

```shell
docker login --username GITHUB_USERNAME --password PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

You should now be ready to pull the image.

If you do not wish to pull the pre-build image,
please add the following under the application service in the docker-compose.yaml file in order to build the image yourself.

```yml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: .docker/application.Dockerfile
```

### How to use the graphql endpoint

When everything is up and running, browse to `localhost:4000/graphql`

You should now see a graphql playound.

Go ahead and execute following query.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    email
  }
}
```

Paste the query and press the "play-iconed" button.

You should now be able to see list of all the users that are in the database.

The docker-compose actually starts 3 containers, mysql, the graphql server and phpmyadmin.
You can visit `localhost:8000` to then enter `root` as username and `root` as pssword to login and verify that the database dump is loaded correctly. You can also enter the mysql container by

```shell
docker exec -it mysql "mysql -u root -p"
```

if you wish to query the database using mysql CLI.

### Writing and Deleting data

Once you have a list of users, pick a random id from the list and execute following `mutation`

```graphql
mutation {
  writeAndDeleteUser(id: "20E6EC50-F135-A3D3-9A9B-51423745D162") {
    message
    code
  }
}
```

If everything went well, then you should be prompted with following

```json
{
  "data": {
    "writeAndDeleteUser": {
      "message": "User has been successfully written to output.json and row for id: 20E6EC50-F135-A3D3-9A9B-51423745D162 is now deleted",
      "code": "200"
    }
  }
}
```

You can find the file where the data has been written in under the `output folder` named `output.json`
